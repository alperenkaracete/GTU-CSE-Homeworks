The Smart Minibar with Object Detection using Webcam and Firebase is an innovative system that combines a webcam, the MobileNet SSD v2 object detection model, and Firebase as the real-time database. The purpose of this project is to create a smart minibar that can track and manage the inventory of items inside it, provide real-time monitoring, and automate the billing process based on the items taken by the user.

The system utilizes a webcam connected to the minibar, which captures real-time images of the minibar's contents. These images are then processed using the MobileNet SSD v2 model, a trained object detection model capable of recognizing and localizing various objects within the minibar. To train the model, a set of training images consisting of labeled examples of minibar items is used. This enables the model to accurately detect and classify the items.Used products in this project are Cola,Fanta,Sprite and water.

Firebase serves as the real-time database for storing and managing the inventory details of the minibar items. The database stores information such as item names, quantities, and user informations. The system records the user's actions, tracks the items taken from the minibar, and updates the inventory and user's bill in the Firebase database accordingly.
